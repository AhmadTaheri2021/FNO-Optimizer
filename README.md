## ðŸ§  Overview

The **FNO algorithm** is a novel metaheuristic approach based on two key behaviors:

- **Farthest Better**: Exploration toward far, high-potential regions.
- **Nearest Worse**: Avoidance of nearby low-quality regions.

A unique **Dynamic Focus Strategy (DFS)** is introduced to balance exploration and exploitation dynamically over iterations.
